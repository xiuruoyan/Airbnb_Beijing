## Project 1: Look into Airbnb Beijing Data

### Project summary: 
When I choose an Airbnb, I always see the scores and reviews to make my decisions. In this project, I want to see if it's a common behavior based on Airbnb Data. There're three questions I tried to answer.  
1. Does score influence availability?  
2. If yes, how to improve scores?
3. How to improve availability based on reviews?
